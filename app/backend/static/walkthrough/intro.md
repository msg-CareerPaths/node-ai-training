# Product Walkthrough

Welcome to the walkthrough. This short guide lives on the backend so it can be served directly by the API.

- Start by exploring the catalog to see available items.
- Add a couple of products to your cart.
- Proceed to checkout to experience the end-to-end flow.

Use the `/walkthrough/files` endpoint to list all available assets, or download a specific file with `/walkthrough/files/:filename`.
